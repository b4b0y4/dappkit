# Theme + Notifications Starter + ...

A zero-dependency template for a quick start with a theme switcher and a clean notification system. No build tools required—just open `index.html` in your browser.

## Features

-   **Theme Switcher**: A reusable theme switcher with single-click to toggle between light and dark modes, and a double-click to reset to the system preference.
-   **Notification System**: Modern, non-blocking slide-in notifications (toasts) with duration, a close button, and a progress bar.
